## WEEK 3
#### HTML first websites


I bought the big, fun, colorful book of HTML teachings required for this class, and frankly it's been very helpful in understanding what all these little tags and elements really mean and how we can use them. And it's written in an exciting way that won't put me to sleep (in fact I've had some nights where I stayed up a few minutes later to finish a chapter on HTML coding, which isn't something I would say even a few months prior).


The first website assignment was simple enough, the only trouble here came in remembering to set up the doctype and head and body tags. After that, throwing everything between paragraph and heading tags made the website. Pretty basic stuff as far as HTML goes.

#### Extras
Example of a basic HTML website setup, similar to the class example.

```
HTML
<!doctype hmtl>
<html>
  <head>
    <!--this is a comment. and this meta tag below is also a difficult thing to remember.-->
    <meta charset="utf8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Big heading</h1>
    <p>Normal text in a paragraph.</p>
    <h2>Smaller heading</h2>
    <p>More paragraph stuff.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
