# Week 2

## Setting Up

1. Atom
  * Downloaded Atom for markdown purposes
  * Can also use this program for another class
  * Utilizes p5 and javascript files
  * I used Sublime text editor last semester, so Atom is new to me.

2. GitHub
  * Built up my github account last semester
  * I choose to use the GitShell instead of SourceTree
  * I am decently acquainted with GitHub.

## Weekly Work
   1. Downloaded Atom
   2. Looked at examples
      1. couldn't figure out how to order sublists with numerals instead of numbers
      2. but here's an attempt

   3. Created the test.txt
     - created in powershell, typed in notepad, then edited in atom
  4. uploaded examples up to github.com through the git shell
