## Week 5

##### In which I ask everyone about pizza

My questionnaire is about pizza. What can I say, it was on the mind when I was wracking for ideas. Originally, since classmates typically ask me for help with some concepts in this class, I thought of making a questionnaire about this class and needing help with it. However, this idea didn't come close to yielding five questions, and frankly it seemed like a pompous thing to do. So pizza it is.

I made this slice in Paint. It's pepperoni.

##### Struggling with all these form elements

I actually had a degree of difficulty getting this week's assignment down. All the different types of inputs we had to do all melded together for me at times. While I think I hit off all the things on the list, there might still be something I missed.

Here's how I kept track of the specifications. This was about thirty minutes into the assignment.

The last one was achieved by directing you to the Pizza Hut website when you clicked submit, regardless of the information. I felt this was a little much on the nose, so I instead changed it to just loop to the same form. I suppose I missed that one, in this case.

##### Input form method id name label

I'll have to keep messing around with these elements, because these were really hard to distinguish if they were working or not. They'd work regardless of what you added in the name and id tags, but not quite in the way you'd want them to unless you pushed the site online and tested it there. That's why there's so many commits for this week on my end. Half of it was on Atom's preview, the other was checking with the actual site.
