##### February 15
###### The day I stared at html until my eyes fell out
---
I spent most of the day on the 15th working on this, and I ended up finishing it all. I hope I didn't go too overboard with the assignment, but I chose to do a real recipe because I just happened to have it on hand. Unintentionally, I may have taught some of you how to cook some pretty rad food.

The big takeaway this week was that there are quite a lot of ways to put emphasis on or organize your body text. It was difficult to fit all of the pieces together (hence why I had to just tack the leftovers at the end of the page.) I'm pretty happy that I have created a pretty decent beginner website after only learned how to create one last week.

I decided to link this page back to the first page we made, my "home page." It may serve as a hub for all these projects and maybe by the end of the class I'll have a proper website on my hands.

##### The Process
###### Where discovering Atom shortcuts saved me at least an hour
---
1. Found my recipe, or rather, opened it up from my bookmarks
* Read all the examples, over and over again
* Referenced examples continuously until the website was built. I tried to cover all the bases.
  * not listed: a lot of coffee breaks*

##### The WayBack Machine
###### It takes me waaaaay back

Ah, nostalgia. I grew up with the Internet. These barebones html websites we build are reminiscent of days of Internet past, but nothing quite beats actually viewing the fossil records of a webpage. The Internet has certainly developed its own rapid culture and history in the scant amount of years it has been around. I started web surfing at age seven, back when the sites looked like disgusting (yet, retroactively charming) collages of stuff the site creator thought was cool. My personal favorite example of this is [Cameron's World](http://www.cameronsworld.net/), a huge collection of ancient Internet artifacts in the form of old sites. It looks like vomit compared to sites nowadays (and frankly it looks like vomit in general), but it's a scroll down memory lane, if you've been around the net as long as I have.

But enough about all that. Let's look at Google. I remember when Google was released around 2000. I had no idea what it was, but it was something the grown-ups were talking about.

I never got to see the beta, but this is about the earliest I could find where it still looks like Google. The code is pretty basic, but what could you expect? Programming was a simpler art in '98.

Our overlords today. Doesn't it seem like Google is eventually going to own everything? Maybe not. Their site and brand looks much, much cleaner and their html has quite a bit going on now.

Speaking of Google, let's look at another site I remember from my youth: YouTube. Still one of the pillars of the Internet nowadays, back then I was watching kids with enough bravado to operate their parents' camera to film themselves blowing stuff up with firecrackers or video game gameplay videos where the camera was pointed at the TV, all on a nice 240p resolution.

![YouTube then]()
Man, even the old slogan "Broadcast Yourself" is bringing back crazy nostalgia. The code is relatively tiny and so are the video thumbnails. This was back before Google owned the site, too.

![YouTube now]()
Nowadays, people can launch a career just entertaining people with videos. YouTube has come a long way, and Google buying them might have had a hand in that. The html is *monstrous* and a lot is going on to keep this media platform afloat.
